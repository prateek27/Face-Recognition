Make sure you have openCV installed and configured. 
make an opencv bash alias in the home directory.
1)Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
$ opencv eigenfacerec.cpp
$ ./eigenfacerec training.csv

2)The url for test image can be changed in the the cpp file.I have taken it as url from test-set folder Given Along.
